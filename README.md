## Why Paperlib?

You may noticed that conference papers are in major in our research community, which is different from other subjects. Without DOI, ISBN, metadata of a lot of conference papers are hard to lookup (e.g., NIPS, ICLR etc.). When we cite a publication in our draft paper, we need to manually search the publication information of it in Google Scholar or DBLP.

What we need may be: import a paper from a PDF file, scrape the metadata of it as accurately as possible, simply organise the library, and export it to BibTex when we are writing our own paper.

That is Paperlib.

*Why not Zotero, Mendely?*

They are both great tools. But, compatibility with all subjects means a compromise especially the accurate metadata scraping. A modern UI. No extra useless features.


## Highlights

-   Scrape paper’s metadata and **code repository** from arXiv, doi.org, DBLP, openreview.net, IEEE, and PaperwithCode etc. Tailored for computer science.
-   Fulltext and advanced search.
-   Rating, flag, tag, folder and note.
-   Cloud sync, supports macOS and Windows.

### Metadata Scrapers
My research topic is computer vision, which is only one piece of puzzle of the computer science. If the [builtin metadata scrapers](https://github.com/GeoffreyChen777/paperlib/tree/electron/packages/preload/repositories/scraper-repository/scrapers) are not suitable for your research, feel free to open an issue or pull request.

### New Features

I'm open to any new feature request, we can discuss it in the issue.
